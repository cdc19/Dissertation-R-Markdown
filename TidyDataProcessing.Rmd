#Available Artifacts

The following is a list of artifacts currently available from five annual offerings of the program.  The artifacts from the first cohort (2012) are incomplete. There is some summary data available that can help in developing an understanding of the 2012 cohort. The 2012 ummary sdata will be incorporated into the narrative where appropriate. The artififacts from the most current cohort (2016) are still being assembled.

#Application Data

The applications were collected using an online application. The composition of the application evolved over time and questions were added or updated before each new cohort. This required a bit of data collection and data wrangling to get the data into a form for analysis.

^1^ These fields were added to aid in data analysis.  
^2^ These fields will be redacted in final data set.  
  
**Notes:**  

* Some of the records from the original data set contain duplicate data. These records were created when participants completed the application twice. The last application (Highest Entry ID #) submitted was retained for data analysis.  The earlier submissions are marked as "Duplicate" in the full data set for reference. These will be removed prior to data analysis.

* It is also noted that for the for some years the "Entry ID" numbers do not start at #1.  This could be data that was removed by the program organizers, or it could be the earlier entries were test data from testing the application from prior to publication.

## Compiling the Data

The application data was provided in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. For some cohorts (2014 & 2015) there is a raw data spreadsheet as exported from the online application and a separate spreadsheet with additional information that was used in the admissions decision-making process. For other cohorts (2013, 2016), it appears as if the application export spreadsheet was edited to add information and document the decision-making process. 

**Notes: **

* For 2012, the applications were collected on paper forms and e-mailed. Unfortunately, the 2012 forms have been lost and are not available for analysis.
* In some cases, information had to be compiled from other data sources to complete the data set.   
* Team assignments and completion data were gathered and verified through the attendance worksheets. Teams were assigned an ID (A:H) so that they can be anonymized in the final data set. Team letter assignments were recorded on the original attendance spreadsheets. This portion of the data collection process was completed by hand using an Excel spreadsheet. 
* Each cohort data was stored in an individual spreadsheet and then exported into a .csv file for import into R.

##Preparing the Data for analysis

In this first R block, the individual cohort .csv data files are combined into a dataframe.  Empty values are properly coded with "NA" and then duplicate records (rows) are removed from the dataset.  Once all the dataframes were complete, they are combined together into a single dataframe.  This dataframe is stored as 'Applicants.csv' for use in the quantitative analysis. 

```{r Read Data, eval=FALSE}
## Reading data and combining into one dataframe.
## This block does not need to execute after initial data tidying. 

# Read Applicants data from cohort application files and remove observations marked duplicate.
Applicants12 <- read.csv("2012Applicants.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
Applicants12 <- filter(Applicants12, Accepted != "Duplicate")

Applicants13 <- read.csv("2013Applicants.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
Applicants13 <- filter(Applicants13, Accepted != "Duplicate")

Applicants14 <- read.csv("2014Applicants.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
Applicants14 <- filter(Applicants14, Accepted != "Duplicate")

Applicants15 <- read.csv("2015Applicants.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
Applicants15 <- filter(Applicants15, Accepted != "Duplicate")

Applicants16 <- read.csv("2016Applicants.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
Applicants16 <- filter(Applicants16, Accepted != "Duplicate")

# Merge Applicants from individual cohort Applicants tables into one 'Applicants' table.
Applicants <- rbind(Applicants16, Applicants15)
Applicants <- rbind(Applicants, Applicants14)
Applicants <- rbind(Applicants, Applicants13)
Applicants <- rbind(Applicants, Applicants12)

str(Applicants)

```

## Tidying the Data

After reviewing the data with 'str(Applicants)' it is apparant the factors are not consistent for all variables.  This may be due to the fact that as the application form was edited, different spellings for various factors were used. This block cleans up the inconsistencies for each of the factors and shortens some of the factor labels so that they are easier to manipulate and display in tables. 


```{r Tidy Data, eval=FALSE}
## Cleaning up factor labels so that analysis will be consistent.
## This block does not need to execute after initial data tidying. 

# Create degree indicators that are one word in length.
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "GED or High school diploma", "HS")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "undergrad", "HS")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "High school graduate", "HS")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "Associate's degree", "Associate")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "A.A.", "Associate")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "Bachelor's degree", "Bachelor")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "B.A.", "Bachelor")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "B.S.", "Bachelor")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "B.F.A.", "Bachelor")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "Master's degree", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "M.S.", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "M.A.", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "MBA", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "M.B.A.", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "J.D.", "Master")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "Ph.D.", "Doctorate")
Applicants$Degree <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Degree, "PhD", "Doctorate")
Applicants$Degree <- factor(Applicants$Degree, levels=c("HS", "Associate", "Bachelor", "Master", "Doctorate"), ordered=TRUE)

#Update Enties for questions which are parsing into multiple factors
Applicants$Q5a <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Q5a, "Gain self confidence", "Gain self-confidence")
Applicants$Q5a <- factor(Applicants$Q5a)
Applicants$Q5f <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Q5f, "All of the above.", "All of the above")
Applicants$Q5f <- factor(Applicants$Q5f)
Applicants$Q8 <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Q8, "Yes (Please answer Question 11.)", "Yes")
Applicants$Q8 <- str_replace_all(Applicants$Q8, "Yes (Please answer Question 9.)", "Yes")

# Remove Duplicate factors and ensure variables are factors.
Applicants$Accepted <- factor(Applicants$Accepted, levels=c("Yes", "No"), ordered=TRUE)
Applicants$Decision <- factor(Applicants$Decision, levels=c("Yes", "No"), ordered=TRUE)
Applicants$Finished <- factor(Applicants$Finished, levels=c("Yes", "No"), ordered=TRUE)
Applicants$Q8 <- factor(Applicants$Q8)


```

## Annoynomizing the Data Set
The final data set has been cleansed to remove all identifying information so it is a truly anonymous data set for analysis.  Only columns with respondant data will be included, all participant identifying information and all references to program name and university will be changed.  The dataframe is saved as 'Applicants.csv'.  For all future iterations of analysis, the data will be loaded from 'Applicants.csv', and previous blocks will not execute ('eval=FALSE').  This annonymized data set is the only version of the data that will be made available for analysis via GitHub.

**Notes:**   

* All references to the program name, the university, and other identifiable indicators have been replaced with generic terms surrounded by asteriks. Ex. *program*, *university*, *company*, etc.  This process was completed manually in Excel by reading through applicant responses to find all identifying data and replacing it with generic placeholders. 

```{r Anonymous Data, eval=FALSE}
# Choosing the colums to be included in the annoymized data set.
Applicants <- select(Applicants, Identifier, TeamID, Cohort, Accepted, Decision, Finished, Team, Degree, Experience, contains("Q"))

# Save the file for later analysis. 
write.csv(Applicants, file="Applicants.csv")
save(Summative, file = "data/Summative.Rda")
```

#Summative Evaluation 

This code can be used to Tidy individual years, or the aggregated data.  To analyze an individual year, comment out the lines that combine the data sets.   

* `CodeBook.xlsx` contains the variable names (question numbers), the text of the corresponding question, and an inventory for which years the question appeared on the survey.
* `Summative.csv` contains the combined survey data.
* Individual files `2013Summative.csv` through `2016Summative.csv` were created to hold individual year data. 
* The finished dataframe `Summative.Rda` has been exported for use in the analysis.

## Compiling the Data 

* For cohorts 2013 - 2015 the surveys were completed in paper and pencil format.  A matching survey was created in Qualtrics and survey responses were hand entered and exported as a .csv file. 
* For 2016, the survey results were collected in Survey Monkey, results were exported as a .csv file. 
* Survey responses for 2012 are missing from the available data. 

While many of the questions in the 2016 survey are identical to 2013 - 2015, the export from SurveyMonkey was substantially different.  To prepare the data for use in this analysis, variable names had to be hand entered to match those from the Qualtrics import.  Likert Scale responses all used the same 5 point scale, but were configured to use different indicators.  These differences are noted in the code book.

The following code block coverts the numerical response for Question 6: "Who is your mentor?" to the team codes. These codes are assigned to maintain anonymity of teams and mentors. The 2016 Mentors were updated by hand due to the data being encoded using full text descriptions.

Summative <- bind_rows(Summative, S2013)
```

The following code block coverts the numerical response items into factor response items that will be easier to analyze. This block only affects 2013 - 2015 data as 2016 already has the factored response items for these questions.
